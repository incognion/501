### Q2. Why “Wehnelt Electrode” is used in Thermionic Electron Guns? What is the role of Wehnelt Electrode in conventional electron guns? Why “Wenhelt Electrode” is not required for field-emission electron gun?

### Ans.
The Wehnelt electrode is used in thermionic electron guns to control the electron emission from the cathode. Its primary role is to focus and shape the electron beam by creating a well-defined potential barrier and controlling the flow of electrons. Here's a breakdown of its role in conventional electron guns and why it's not required for field-emission electron guns:

**Role of Wehnelt Electrode in Conventional Electron Guns:**

1. **Control of Electron Emission:**
   - The cathode in a thermionic electron gun emits electrons due to thermal excitation. The Wehnelt electrode surrounds the cathode and is set at a negative potential compared to the cathode.
   - This negative potential forms a potential barrier that helps in controlling the emission of electrons. It prevents the emission of electrons until a certain potential is reached.

2. **Focusing and Shaping the Electron Beam:**
   - The Wehnelt electrode focuses the emitted electrons into a well-defined beam by controlling the shape and convergence of the electron trajectories.
   - By adjusting the potential on the Wehnelt electrode, the size and shape of the resulting electron beam can be manipulated.

3. **Improving Electron Optics:**
   - The Wehnelt electrode contributes to the overall electron optics of the system, enhancing the performance of the electron gun in terms of beam quality and control.

**Why Wehnelt Electrode is Not Required for Field-Emission Electron Guns:**

1. **Different Electron Emission Mechanism:**
   - In field-emission electron guns, electrons are emitted by the application of a strong electric field (rather than thermal excitation as in thermionic emission).
   - The strong electric field at the cathode tip is sufficient to overcome the potential barrier without the need for an additional Wehnelt electrode.

2. **Inherent Focusing in Field Emission:**
   - Field-emission electron guns inherently provide a more focused electron beam without the need for an additional electrode to shape and focus the beam.
   - The geometry of the cathode tip and the applied electric field naturally lead to a more collimated and focused electron beam.

3. **Simplification of Design:**
   - Field-emission electron guns are often designed to be simpler in structure compared to thermionic guns. The absence of the Wehnelt electrode reduces the complexity of the electron gun design.

In summary, the Wehnelt electrode is essential in conventional thermionic electron guns to control and shape the emitted electron beam. However, in field-emission electron guns, the different mechanism of electron emission and inherent focusing properties eliminate the need for a Wehnelt electrode, simplifying the design and improving the efficiency of the electron gun.

### Q3. What would be the approximate compositions obtained from EDAX from Magnesium Hydride (MgH2) sample?

### Ans.
Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDAX or EDS) provides information about the elemental composition of a sample based on the characteristic X-rays emitted when the sample is bombarded with high-energy electrons. In the case of Magnesium Hydride (MgH2), we can expect the primary elements to be magnesium (Mg) and hydrogen (H).

The approximate composition obtained from EDAX for MgH2 would be predominantly magnesium and hydrogen. The weight percentage of each element would depend on the stoichiometry of MgH2. The molecular weight of MgH2 is approximately 24.31 g/mol for magnesium and 2.02 g/mol for hydrogen.

To calculate the theoretical weight percentage of each element in MgH2:

1. **Magnesium (Mg):**
   - Atomic weight of Mg = 24.31 g/mol
   - Number of moles of Mg in MgH2 = 1 (from the formula)
   - Theoretical weight percentage of Mg = (Atomic weight of Mg / Molecular weight of MgH2) * 100

2. **Hydrogen (H):**
   - Atomic weight of H = 2.02 g/mol
   - Number of moles of H in MgH2 = 2 (from the formula)
   - Theoretical weight percentage of H = (Atomic weight of H / Molecular weight of MgH2) * 100

Keep in mind that the actual composition obtained from EDAX may vary due to factors such as sample impurities, preparation methods, and analysis conditions. It's also important to consider any potential background signal or contributions from the substrate on which the sample is mounted.

In summary, based on the stoichiometry of MgH2, the approximate composition from EDAX analysis would show a significant percentage of magnesium and hydrogen, with the exact values calculated based on the molecular weights of the elements.

### Q4. How a SAED pattern of a bacteria and a virus looks like? Why?

### Ans.
Single-crystal electron diffraction (SAED) patterns are obtained when a crystalline sample is illuminated with electrons, and the resulting diffraction pattern is recorded. Crystalline materials, including certain biological specimens like viruses, may exhibit SAED patterns. However, obtaining SAED patterns from bacteria is more challenging due to their larger and less ordered structures.

**1. SAED Pattern of a Virus:**
   - Viruses are typically smaller and may have a more ordered internal structure, especially in their protein capsids. If a virus is sufficiently crystalline, it may produce discernible diffraction patterns.
   - The SAED pattern of a virus would consist of spots corresponding to the crystal lattice planes within the virus structure. The arrangement of these spots would provide information about the symmetry and internal ordering of the viral particles.

**2. SAED Pattern of a Bacteria:**
   - Bacteria are generally larger and more complex structures compared to viruses. Obtaining a SAED pattern from a bacterial sample is challenging due to the lack of internal crystallinity in most bacterial structures.
   - The SAED pattern of a bacterium is likely to be diffuse or featureless, reflecting the lack of a well-defined crystal lattice within the bacterial structure.

**Why Diffraction Patterns from Bacteria are Diffuse:**
   - Bacteria are composed of complex mixtures of macromolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, which do not exhibit the long-range order required for diffraction.
   - Biological macromolecules in bacteria are generally amorphous or have only short-range order, making it difficult to generate well-defined diffraction patterns.

**Considerations:**
   - Obtaining SAED patterns from biological specimens, especially viruses and bacteria, often requires specialized techniques such as electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to preserve the native structure and prevent damage from the electron beam.
   - The size, composition, and symmetry of the biological specimen play crucial roles in determining whether a clear SAED pattern can be obtained.

In summary, while viruses may exhibit SAED patterns if they have sufficient internal crystallinity, obtaining SAED patterns from bacteria is challenging due to their larger and more complex structures, lack of internal crystallinity, and the dominance of amorphous or short-range ordered components. Specialized techniques and careful sample preparation are often required to obtain meaningful diffraction information from biological specimens.
